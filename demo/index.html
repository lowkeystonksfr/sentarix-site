            The demo displays two versions of the same system. The first view
            shows how digital mechanics feel today. The second view shows how
            they feel once SentariX provides a consistent sense of time.

              <p class="cardText">
                RAW represents the experience most people know. Small skips,
                slight pauses, and uneven responses create a sense of instability
                that breaks rhythm. Even very small shifts change how movement
                and interaction feel for the user.

              <p class="cardText">
                SentariX keeps every moment aligned with a steady sense of time.
                Movements feel natural and predictable. The experience stays
                smooth regardless of what the system is dealing with underneath.
                Users feel a clear and stable response at all times.

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">Why this matters</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Even simple mechanics feel different when timing is unstable.
            SentariX removes this instability entirely. The result is a reliable
            feel that remains the same for every user during the entire
            experience. The difference shown in this demo is only a starting
            point. It becomes much stronger inside real digital worlds.

            A short showcase video will appear here soon. It will present RAW
            and SentariX side by side in real time, making the difference clear.
