        <!-- CORE PROBLEM -->
        <section class="sectionWide">
          <h2 class="sectionTitle">The core problem industries face</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Every industry that relies on digital interaction suffers from the same issue.  
            Systems do not maintain a steady feel from moment to moment.  
            The experience shifts constantly and users sense it instantly even when the screen looks stable.
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top:40px;">
            These shifts break rhythm.  
            They change how movement feels, how responses land, and how users connect with what they are doing.  
            It is the reason the same action can feel crisp one moment and unsettled the next.  
            This inconsistency has always been accepted because nothing existed to hold perception steady.  
            SentariX changes this entirely.

        <!-- RAW VS SENTARIX -->

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">What you are seeing</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            The demo compares two versions of the same system.  
            One represents the unstable feel the world is used to.  
            The other shows what happens when mechanics operate on a consistently aligned foundation.

              <h3 class="cardTitle">RAW Feel</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                RAW represents the world today.  
                Small skips, uneven responses, and internal fluctuations break the flow.  
                Users constantly adapt without realizing it because the feel never holds steady.  
                This inconsistency affects every digital system people interact with.

              <p class="cardText">
                SentariX restores a steady, unified feel.  
                Every moment remains aligned with the next, making movement and interaction natural and predictable.  
                Internal fluctuations lose their impact and the experience stays smooth across all devices and conditions.  
                Users feel clarity and reliability from the very first interaction.

        <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
        <section class="sectionWide">
          <h2 class="sectionTitle">Why this matters</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Consistency is the foundation of any responsive experience.  
            When the feel stays steady, users build confidence.  
            Mechanics become easier to control.  
            Interaction becomes more intuitive and more connected.  
            The system finally behaves the way people expect.
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top:40px;">
            This demo is a simplified example.  
            Inside full digital worlds the improvement is far greater.  
            SentariX establishes a new standard of consistency that elevates everything built on top of it.

            A short showcase video will appear here soon.  
            It will present RAW and SentariX side by side in real time, making the difference unmistakable.
