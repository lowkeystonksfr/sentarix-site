            This demonstration reveals how digital systems behave today and how they behave once SentariX provides a consistent sense of time. The difference is immediate and impossible to ignore.

        <!-- CORE PROBLEM -->
        <section class="sectionWide">
          <h2 class="sectionTitle">The core problem industries face</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Every industry that relies on digital mechanics suffers from the same issue. Systems do not keep a steady feel from moment to moment. Timing shifts constantly. Even when performance looks stable on paper, the user experience is not.  
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top:40px;">
            These shifts are small but powerful. They change how movement feels, how interaction responds, and how users connect with what they are doing. It is the reason the same action can feel clean in one moment and unsettled in the next.  
            This instability has always been accepted as normal because nothing existed to correct it.  
            SentariX changes this completely.

        <!-- RAW VS SENTARIX -->
        <section class="sectionWide">
          <h2 class="sectionTitle">What you are seeing</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            The demo compares two versions of the same system. One represents the unstable feel the world has lived with for years. The other shows what happens when experiences run on a consistent foundation.
          </p>

          <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">RAW Feel</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                RAW represents the world as it is today. Timing shifts slightly with every moment.  
                Small skips and uneven responses create breaks in rhythm.  
                These inconsistencies make mechanics feel unpredictable and cause users to adjust constantly without realizing it.  
                This is the default state of nearly every digital experience.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">SentariX Feel</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                SentariX replaces instability with a steady sense of time.  
                Each moment aligns cleanly with the next, making movement and interaction feel natural and predictable.  
                The system stays smooth regardless of hardware differences, background activity, or other environmental pressures.  
                Users experience clarity and reliability at all times.

        <!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
        <section class="sectionWide">
          <h2 class="sectionTitle">Why this matters</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Consistency is not a minor improvement. It changes the foundation of the experience.  
            When timing stays steady, mechanics become trustworthy. Control feels familiar. Precision becomes easier.  
            The user no longer fights subtle swings in feel.  
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top:40px;">
            This demo is a simple example.  
            Inside full digital worlds the improvement is far more dramatic.  
            SentariX establishes a new standard of consistency that elevates every system built on top of it.

            A short showcase video will appear here soon. It will present RAW and SentariX side by side in real time, making the difference unmistakable.
