            SentariX Prime™ is the dedicated consistency layer for real time systems.  
            It represents the first step toward global consistency in digital interaction.

        <!-- PROBLEM -->
        <section class="section">
          <h2 class="sectionTitle">The real problem</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Digital experiences rarely feel the same from one moment to the next.  
            Some moments feel responsive and others feel unsteady.  
            Users sense this instantly because the overall feel never truly holds its shape.
          </p>

          <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Frames feel different</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Even when everything appears smooth, the feel can shift.  
                Inputs move from heavy to light and control never fully settles into a reliable rhythm.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Inputs do not land consistently</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                The same action can feel sharp in one moment and uncertain in the next.  
                No existing approach guarantees the same feel for every input.

            </div>

              <h3 class="cardTitle">Stability breaks easily</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Small changes in perception stack up and break the experience.  
                These shifts interrupt flow and make interactions feel disconnected.

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">What SentariX focuses on</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            SentariX is dedicated to making digital experiences feel stable and predictable.  
            Our systems are built to keep perception steady so users can rely on how the experience behaves.
          </p>

              <h3 class="cardTitle">A consistent foundation for feel</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                SentariX systems keep perception smooth and connected.  
                The goal is to remove the subtle shifts that make interactions feel uncertain.

            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Equal feel across setups</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Users should share the same quality of control and stability regardless of their setup.  
                SentariX works to keep experiences aligned across different devices and conditions.

              <h3 class="cardTitle">A sealed consistency layer</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                The consistency layer remains sealed and self managed.  
                Teams gain the benefits of stable feel without needing to manage how it is achieved.

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">Where SentariX fits first</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Any experience that relies on precision, control, or immersion gains an immediate upgrade from stronger consistency.
          </p>

          <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Competitive play</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Movement, shooting, building, and precise mechanics become more stable for every player.  
                Clarity and fairness return when feel stops shifting.

              <h3 class="cardTitle">Training and simulation</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                A consistent feel makes training more repeatable and more transferable across sessions and devices.

              <p class="cardText">
                When perception drives immersion, inconsistency breaks the experience.  
                SentariX systems keep perception aligned and steady.
