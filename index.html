          <h2 class="sectionTitle">The real problem</h2>
          <p class="sectionLead">
            Digital experiences have a hidden issue that everyone feels but no
            one names clearly. Responsiveness changes from moment to moment.
            Small variations appear in subtle ways and the experience never
            feels truly uniform.
          </p>

          <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Frames that never feel the same</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Users move, aim, build, or steer, yet every frame lands a little
                differently. Some moments feel heavy, others floaty. Frame rate
                improves but the sense of control never really locks in.
              </p>

              <h3 class="cardTitle">Inputs that do not match intention</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                The same click or stick movement can feel crisp in one moment
                and muddy in the next. Users blame their device, the network, or
                themselves, because there is no clear layer that keeps the feel
                steady.

              <h3 class="cardTitle">Engines that only see raw conditions</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Engines react directly to fluctuating conditions. Network
                variation, platform quirks, and local load all bleed into the
                user experience, producing a different sense of time from one
                instant to the next.

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">What SentariX provides</h2>
          <p class="sectionLead">
            SentariX sits above the rest of the stack and maintains a stable
            perceived timeline for your experience. Engines keep running as
            usual, but the user feels a steady, predictable world.
          </p>

          <div class="grid">
            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Perfect step time for perception</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                SentariX produces a stable step value on every update. Your loop
                uses that value to advance simulation and presentation so that
                each frame belongs to the same rhythm, even when real
                conditions are uneven.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3 class="cardTitle">Consistent feel across hardware</h3>
              <p class="cardText">
                Players on very different setups can share the same sense of
                control. SentariX smooths out the hidden variations that make
                high frame count users feel different from everyone else.
              </p>

              <p class="cardText">
                The engine ships as a sealed SDK with a very small public
                surface. You feed it samples from your world and read a single
                step value. No internal details are exposed.

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">Where SentariX fits first</h2>
          <p class="sectionLead">
            Any experience that lives or dies on feel benefits from a stable
            perceived timeline.

              <p class="cardText">
                Shooting, movement, building, and precision inputs stay aligned
                with the user’s intention. Consistent feel makes skill more
                readable and raises trust in the experience.

              <p class="cardText">
                When reaction and control matter, uneven feel can break
                learning. SentariX keeps each scenario aligned with the same
                internal rhythm, so practice transfers better.

                Head movement, input, and scene updates can share a unified

                valuable it becomes to keep time itself consistent.
