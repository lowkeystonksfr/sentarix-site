          <h2 class="sectionTitle">The story behind SentariX</h2>

          <p class="sectionLead">
            Almost every player has felt it.  
            One moment the game feels crisp and responsive, the next it feels off.  
            The visuals get better every year, hardware gets faster, engines evolve,  
            but the actual feel of the game never becomes truly stable.
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            For decades players adapted to this instability without questioning it.  
            They blamed their mouse, their PC, their connection, their frame rate,  
            or even themselves.  
            The truth is simple  
            the world has never had a consistent timing layer that keeps  
            perception steady for every user.
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            SentariX changes this.  
            It introduces a stable internal rhythm that every action, frame,  
            and interaction follows.  
            When timing becomes consistent the game finally feels the same  
            every moment you play.
