          <p class="heroSubtitle">
            SentariX exists to take the feel of real time experiences seriously
            and to treat perceived time as a first class system, not a side
            effect.

          <h2 class="sectionTitle">View on the problem</h2>
          <p class="sectionLead">
            Modern engines are very good at rendering, physics, and network
            work, but they still treat the sense of time the user feels as an
            indirect outcome of many competing systems. SentariX treats that
            sense of time as the thing to stabilise first.
          </p>

              <p class="cardText">
                The user does not see internal graphs or logs. They feel a
                world. When that world changes rhythm, trust decays. SentariX
                is built to keep that rhythm steady so that everything else can
                build on top of it.

                Claims about SentariX are designed to be testable. Side by side
                feel tests, frame visualisations, and pilot work make it very
                clear whether the engine is delivering value.

                The first focus is a strong engine that can drop into many
                environments. Over time that foundation can support higher level
                services, tools, and visual layers.

          <p class="sectionLead">
            SentariX is built with a mix of systems thinking, network work, and
            a very direct focus on user feel. The work aims to stay small and
            sharp while partnering with teams that can put the engine in front
            of millions of users.
