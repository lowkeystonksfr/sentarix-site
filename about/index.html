          <p class="sectionLead">
            Digital experiences have advanced in visuals, scale, and complexity, yet their feel has remained unpredictable.  
            Some moments respond cleanly and others do not, creating a gap that users notice even when they cannot identify the cause.  
            This instability was never intentional.  
            Nothing existed to keep perception steady across time, devices, and conditions.
          </p>

          <p class="sectionLead" style="margin-top:40px;">
            SentariX removes this uncertainty.  
            It delivers a consistent feel that makes interactions more confident, more natural, and more reliable.  
            The improvement is immediate and unmistakable.  
            Experiences feel connected from moment to moment, which creates a sense of trust and completeness.
